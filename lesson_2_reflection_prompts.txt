//What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you great .git folder where the respository is saved. This is the first step if you wanna add commits later on.
Note that the git init command doesn't create a first commit, the repository is just empty.

//How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
//What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the container between the working directory and the repository. Files in the staging area are files of the directory that can be commited to the repository.

//How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
//change?

With the git status command you can see how many and which files are in the staging area. With the git diff command you can check the difference in between the file in the staging area
and the original file in the work directory.

//What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
//organized? How would branches help?

When you try out new experimental things branches can be useful. Per experiment you can create a side branch without messing up the main branch.

//How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

As humans are visual creatures, a visual representation in a diagram makes it easier to understand the different branches with their different commits.
It looks like a road that splits up in many different other roads, or like a tree that splits up in different branches, hence the word branch I guess.

//What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
//the diagram the way we do?

The result is that they become one branch again, they take all the changes together who were made seperately and merge them together in one commit.
The new commit still refers back to the older commits of the two branches, that's what the diagram visually presents.

//What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
//manually?

Pros of manually merging is complete control but losing a lot of time, automatic merging is faster but if not careful we can make big mistakes
