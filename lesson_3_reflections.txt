When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you want to have an online back-up of your repository, so in case of theft or accidental deletion by software or hardware crash, you don't lose everything. Also when you want to share your repository with other people to let it get reviewed or collaborate on. Or if you working from different devices (home computer, work computer) on the same repository.
